## ✅ Sample Commit Messages

```
Feat: add macrozone covariate extraction from Level II shapefile

This adds a new script (03c_macrozone_covariates_l2.R) to assign prairie
macroregions based on NA Ecoregion Level II polygons. Output is written to
data/processed/spatial/.
```

```
Docs: move macrozone covariates Rmd log to reports/

Moved 03c Macrozone Covariates from Level II Ecoregions.Rmd from to_check/
into reports/ to reflect finalized covariate pipeline documentation. Part
of Milestone 00 refactor.
```

```
Chore: update .gitignore with large file exclusions for GitHub limits
```

## ✅ Tips for Good Commit Messages

- Use the imperative mood: "Add", not "Added" or "Adds"
- Keep subject lines ≤ 50 characters
- Use the body to explain **why** and optionally **how**
- Group commits by milestone or logical step

# ✅ Semantic Versioning (SemVer) – Recommended Tagging Approach

Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v2.3.1)

Each number has a specific meaning:

| Component	| Changes When...                                      | Example |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| MAJOR	    | Incompatible changes are made (breaks old use)	   | v2.0.0  |
| MINOR	    | New features are added in a backward-compatible way  | v2.1.0  |
| PATCH	    | Bug fixes or minor changes that don’t break anything | v2.1.1  |

## 👇 When to Increment Which?
| Situation	                                        | Version Example |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| You break the API or change file formats	        | v2.0.0          |
| You add a new data field or function (compatible)	| v1.1.0          |
| You fix a bug or typo in documentation/code	    | v1.0.1          |

## 🧠 Why Use SemVer?

- Clear communication of changes

- Enables automation of version checks

- Plays well with Git tags, changelogs, and CI/CD tools

- Supports dependency tracking (e.g., for R packages, Python modules)

---

## 🔖 Optional Extensions

You can also add:

- Pre-releases: v2.0.0-beta, v1.2.0-rc1

- Build metadata: v1.0.0+20240508

---

## 🔧 Suggested Tag Format

Stick to lowercase v prefix: v1.2.0

- This helps distinguish tags from branch names and aligns with GitHub release conventions.

---

## 📂 Tagging Example

```bash
git tag -a v0.3-refactor -m "Refactor project structure and file locations"
git push origin v0.3-refactor
```

# 📓 1. CHANGELOG Format (Based on Keep a Changelog)

Use a CHANGELOG.md file at the root of your project.
