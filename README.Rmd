# Project Description
## Overview

This project supports the estimation of regional skew coefficients for flood frequency analysis in the Great Plains. It emphasizes reproducibility, modular data workflows, and the integration of spatial and climatic covariates.

The workflow uses R and {tidyverse} tools to automate the download, cleaning, joining, and modeling of covariate data associated with gage locations. Covariates include climate normals, terrain characteristics, and site location variables. 

## Current Objective

The primary goal of this phase is to explain spatial variation in station skew — the log-Pearson Type III skew coefficient estimated at individual stream gages — using a set of numeric covariates derived from:

-   Climate normals (precipitation and temperature)

-   Terrain data (elevation and slope)

-   Site location (latitude and longitude)

## Layout of Analysis

To explore the spatial and temporal drivers of flood skewness across diverse landscapes and climates, we adopt a multi-scale hierarchical framework. Variables are organized by spatial-temporal scale, ecological domain, and data type.

```

## Getting Started

Run scripts in order within the `R/` folder. For example:

```   
source("R/01_download/01_get_spatial_data.R")
source("R/02_clean/03_filter_unregulated_gage_data.R")
```
All scripts assume R project is opened at the repository root (e.g., using .Rproj file).

## Reproducibility

This project uses:
- `.gitignore_spatial_template.txt` to exclude large geospatial files
- `git_commit_reference_card.txt` for consistent commit messages
- Modular milestone logs (see `reports/`) to track key development stages

## Versioning

Tagged versions:
- **`v0.3-structure-refactor`** – Major restructure of project folders and files
